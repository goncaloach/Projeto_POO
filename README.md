# Project of the Curricular Unit: Object Oriented Programming
## Disclaimer:
The main branch is a refactor I made to the code 3 years later after the initial code. 
This refactor may have deviated a bit from the original curricular unit learning objectives.

The initial code, the one I made while in college, can be found in a separate branch named 'originalCode'.
All the code inside the 'io.goncaloach' package was made by me. 
The code inside the 'pt.iul.ista.poo' package was made by the teachers of the OOP curricular unit, therefore none of it is mine.
## About:
